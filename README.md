# Advent of Code is Back!

Advent of code is an annual advent calendar of puzzles, that tend to grow more difficult each day. Each day there is a new puzzle to solve using whatever language you feel most comfortable working with. Each day also includes a story like situation, building upon the previous day's story. As you complete a challenge, a new line of the advent calendar is revealed.

This year I've chosen to participate using TypeScript.

If you'd like to participate along with me, you can find this years calendar [here](https://adventofcode.com/2022).
